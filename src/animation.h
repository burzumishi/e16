 * run : A parameter indicating animation progress.
 *       If the animation time is limited (duration > 0), run will go
 *       from ~1023 to 0.
 *       The first call will most likely not have run=1023, but (unless
 *       the animator is killed) the last call will have run=0.
 *       If the animation is not time limited, the first call will
 *       have run=0 (TBD), and the subsequent calls will have run equal
 *       to the time since last call in ms.
 * data: A pointer to extra animator data, as specified when creating the
 *       animator.
 *
 * Because a EObj may be destroyed before then animation is complete, it
 * must be safe to simply free the Animator struct and get on with life,
 * so animations should not require destructor-like functions to run after
 * they are complete.
